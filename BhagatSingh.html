        <h1>Bhagat Singh</h1>
        <h3>Brief Info</h3>
        <p>Bhagat Singh was one of the foremost heroes of the freedom struggle who sacrificed his life happily for the
            sake of his country.<br> His heart was soaked in patriotism from a very tender age. He brought a revolution
            in
            the national movement against the British rule.<br> He was a prominent freedom fighter and inspired the
            youth to
            join the freedom fight against the British.
        </p>

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in the district of Lyallpur in Punjab which is now in Pakistan.
            He was the third son of Sardar Kishan who was a revolutionary himself and Vidywati.<br> His father was in
            jail
            when Bhagat Singh was born. He was a very good student when he was young and very friendly by nature. Upon
            being asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said he would drive the British out of India.<br>
            Bhagat Singh was very perturbed by the Jallianwala tragedy in the year 1912. He was only twelve years old
            then and the incident left a very deep scar in his heart. He brought home a bottle of mud-soaked in the
            blood of the victims and worshipped it.<br> He was always attracted to socialism and he set his path for
            political revolutionaries, which no one even thought of. He was clear in his vision and he dedicated himself
            to accomplish his goals.<br> He dropped out of school and took part in the Congress Movement. He actively
            supported the Swadeshi Movement. He would wear only Khadi and burn foreign clothes.
        </p>

        <h3>What He Did For India?</h3>
        <p>

            Bhagat Singh helped galvanized the Indian Independence Movement
            <br>
            <br>
            Bhagat Singh along with Rajguru shot at John Saunders, mistaking him as Scott, the police officer to avenge
            his death. In 1929, he and Bakuteshwar Dutt exploded a bomb at the Legislative Assembly Hall in Delhi and
            shouted slogans “Inquilab Zindabad” but they did not intend to hurt or kill anyone but to express the
            disagreement with the ordinance of Defense of Indian Act that was to be formulated. They surrendered
            themselves and they were sentenced to 116 days in jail.
            <br>
            <br>


            While in jail, Singh helped organize a hunger strike to protest against prisoner mistreatment, a
            demonstration that gained him wide support in India.

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were convicted of assassinating John Saunders and exploding the bomb at
            the Legislative Assembly Hall and the order of death sentence on 24th March 1931 was passed. But the
            schedule was preponed and they were hanged on 23rd march 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail.
