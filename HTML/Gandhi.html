        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
        <h3>Brief Info</h3>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, India. He became one of the most
            respected spiritual and political leaders of the 1900's. Gandhi helped free the Indian people from British
            rule through nonviolent resistance, and is honoured by Indians as the father of the Indian Nation.

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist,
            and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he
            came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of
            nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking
            adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe
            ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are
            known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his
            death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.
            <br>
            <br>

            Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan
            (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat
            state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
            administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering subjects,
            and the headstrong British political officers in power.
            <br>
            <br>
            Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did not care much for finery or jewelry,
            divided her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days and nights
            of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in
            Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian
            religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus,
            he took for granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification,
            and mutual tolerance between adherents of various creeds and sects.

        <h3>What He Did For India?</h3>
        <p>

            Gandhi returned to active politics in 1930 to protest Britain’s Salt Acts, which not only prohibited Indians
            from collecting or selling salt—a dietary staple—but imposed a heavy tax that hit the country’s poorest
            particularly hard. Gandhi planned a new Satyagraha campaign, The Salt March, that entailed a
            390-kilometer/240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he would collect salt in symbolic defiance of the
            government monopoly.
            <br>
            <br>

            Wearing a homespun white shawl and sandals and carrying a walking stick, Gandhi set out from his religious
            retreat in Sabarmati on March 12, 1930, with a few dozen followers. By the time he arrived 24 days later in
            the coastal town of Dandi, the ranks of the marchers swelled, and Gandhi broke the law by making salt from
            evaporated seawater.
            <br>
            <br>

            Gandhi was released from prison in January 1931, and two months later he made an agreement with Lord Irwin
            to end the Salt Satyagraha in exchange for concessions that included the release of thousands of political
            prisoners. The agreement, however, largely kept the Salt Acts intact. But it did give those who lived on the
            coasts the right to harvest salt from the sea.
            <br>
            <br>

            Mahatma Gandhi led India's independence movement from British Rule and also founded non-violent
            civil obedience while protesting racial segregation Sout Africa. His brithday is now on Indian
            National Holiday, as well as the international Day of Peace



        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
            In 30 January 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assasinated by Nathuram Godse. He died by gun shot. The gun used by
            Nathuram was a Beretta M 1934 Semi - Automatic Pistol. Nathuram Godse tried to kill himseld was unsuccessful
            and got captured by civilians.
            <br>
