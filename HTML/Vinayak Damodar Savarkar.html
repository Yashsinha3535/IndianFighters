        <h1>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</h1>
        <h3>Brief Info</h3>
        <p>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was born on 28 May 1883 in the Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin Hindu family of Damodar and
            Radhabai Savarkar in the village of Bhagur, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra. He had three other
            siblings namely Ganesh, Narayan, and a sister named Maina.

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, byname Vir or Veer, (born May 28, 1883, Bhagur, India—died Feb. 26, 1966, Bombay
            [now Mumbai]), Hindu and Indian nationalist and leading figure in the Hindu Mahasabha (“Great Society of
            Hindus”), a Hindu nationalist organization and political party.
            <br>
            <br>
            In March 1910 Savarkar was arrested on various charges relating to subversion and incitement to war and was
            sent to India for trial and convicted. In a second trial he was convicted of his alleged complicity in the
            assassination of a British district magistrate in India, and, after sentencing, he was transported to the
            Andaman Islands for detention “for life.” He was brought back to India in 1921 and released from detention
            in 1924. While imprisoned he wrote Hinditva: Who Is a Hindu? (1923), coining the term Hindutva
            (“Hinduness”), which sought to define Indian culture as a manifestation of Hindu values; this concept grew
            to become a major tenet of Hindu nationalist ideology.


            <br>
            <br>
            Savarkar resided in Ratnagiri until 1937, when he joined the Hindu Mahasabha, which militantly defended the
            Hindus’ claims of religious and cultural supremacy over Indian Muslims. He served as president of the
            Mahasabha for seven years.

        <h3>What He Did For India?</h3>
        <p>

            While a student of law in London (1906–10), Savarkar helped to instruct a group of Indian revolutionaries in
            methods of sabotage and assassination that associates of his had apparently learned from expatriate Russian
            revolutionaries in Paris. During this period he wrote The Indian War of Independence, 1857 (1909), in which
            he took the view that the Indian Mutiny of 1857 was the first expression of Indian mass rebellion against
            British colonial rule.

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
            In 1943, Mohandas K. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a former member of Mahasabha.
